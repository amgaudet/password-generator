## About
Generates a random password based on user input. User will define the length of the password along with what types of characters it will contain between uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The resulting generated password will appear on the screen above the 'Generate Password' button.

## Description
[Deployed Application](https://amgaudet.github.io/password-generator/")
After clicking the generate password button, the user is prompted for their desired password length. If the user has an input outside the given parameters, the user will be reminded to enter a number between 8 and 128 to generate the password length. The user is then prompted to choose what different characters the password will contain. The script will then populate a string of characters the user selects and generate a password by randomly selecting a character to add to the password a number of times equal to the desired length.
